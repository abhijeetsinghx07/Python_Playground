Challenging competition-level question emphasize logic building and require advanced use of nested loops for solving real-world scenarios.

### 1. Matrix Border Sum

Given a 2D matrix of size \( n \times n \), calculate the sum of all the elements that lie on the border (outermost layer) of the matrix. Assume the input is always square (equal number of rows and columns).  

#### Input Example:
```plaintext
Matrix:
1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9
```
#### Output Example:
```plaintext
Border Sum: 40
```
#### Info:
- Use nested loops to iterate through the rows and columns.
- Sum elements on the first row, last row, first column, and last column while avoiding duplicates.

### 2. Knight’s Tour Validation
#### Problem:  
Given a sequence of positions on a chessboard, validate if the sequence represents a valid knight’s tour. The knight can move in an "L" shape: two steps in one direction and one step perpendicular.  
#### Input Example:
```plaintext
Positions: [(0, 0), (2, 1), (0, 2), (1, 4)]
```
#### Output Example:
```plaintext
Valid: False
```
#### Info:
- Use nested loops to validate if the move between each pair of positions follows the knight’s movement rules.
- Track visited positions to ensure no position is revisited.

Target: 0
```
#### Output Example:
```plaintext
Triplets: [(1, -1, 0), (2, -3, 1)]

### 9. Sudoku Solver
#### Problem:  
Solve a partially filled Sudoku grid using nested loops. A Sudoku grid is valid if every row, column, and 3x3 subgrid contains unique numbers from 1 to 9.
