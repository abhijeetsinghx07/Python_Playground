    Input:
    Enter value of a = 7
    Enter value of b = 5

    Expected output 
    Sum is = 12
    Sub is = 2
    Multiplication is = 35

15. Define a function that accepts roll number and returns whether the student is present or absent.

    Use a list to store sample roll. no.
    Get input from a user and check if the number
    exist in the list or not, if exists return present
    else return absent


16. Define a function in python that accepts 3 values and returns the maximum of three numbers.

    Input:
    Value of a = 30
    Value of b = 22
    value of c = 18

    Expected output 
    30 is the maximum among all


17. Define a function that accepts a number and returns whether the number is even or odd.

    Input:
    Enter a number = 4

    Expected output 
    4 is an even number


    Input:
    Enter a number = 5

    Expected output 
    4 is an odd number


18. Define a function which counts vowels and consonant in a word.

21. Define a function that accepts radius and returns the area of a circle.

    Input:
    Enter radius  4

    Expected output 
    Area of a circle is  50.24


22.  What is the difference between local and global variable?
Answer: Local variable is defined inside the function whereas global variable is defined or declared outside of the function. A local variable is always created during the start of function execution. And is destroyed automatically when the function terminates. And global variable is created when execution starts and terminates when the program execution ends. A global variable is common for all program members but the scope of the local variable is limited to its own function only where it is defined.

23.  What is the scope of a variable (in function)?
Answer: If we are talking about scope, it means we are referring to the visibility of a variable in function. If a variable is defined inside the function then it is called a local variable and its scope is limited to its own function only. And if the variable is defined outside of the function then it is said to be a global variable that is accessible for every member and its scope is available throughout the program.

24.  What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?
Answer: Likewise parameter and arguments are similar terms but there is a slight difference between both of them. Parameters are may be a variable or a value passed through the parenthesis of a function. And the argument is the value to the variable that is sent to the function when it is called.

25. Name three iterable object in Python?
Answer: Iterable objects are the objects whose values or elements can be iterable using a loop i.e. for loop or while loop etc. Three types of iterable object in python are list, tuples and dictionaries etc.

26. What does function returns by default in Python?
Answer: A function should always return a value. If we do not explicitly return a value or statement after the execution of a function then it returns a default value as None implicitly.
