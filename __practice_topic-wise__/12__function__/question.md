21. Define a function that accepts radius and returns the area of a circle.

    Input:
    Enter radius  4

    Expected output 
    Area of a circle is  50.24


22.  What is the difference between local and global variable?
    Answer: Local variable is defined inside the function whereas global variable is defined or declared outside of the function. A local variable is always created during the start of function execution. And is destroyed automatically when the function terminates. And global variable is created when execution starts and terminates when the program execution ends. A global variable is common for all program members but the scope of the local variable is limited to its own function only where it is defined.

23.  What is the scope of a variable (in function)?
    Answer: If we are talking about scope, it means we are referring to the visibility of a variable in function. If a variable is defined inside the function then it is called a local variable and its scope is limited to its own function only. And if the variable is defined outside of the function then it is said to be a global variable that is accessible for every member and its scope is available throughout the program.

24. What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?
    Answer: Likewise parameter and arguments are similar terms but there is a slight difference between both of them. Parameters are may be a variable or a value passed through the parenthesis of a function. And the argument is the value to the variable that is sent to the function when it is called.

25. Name three iterable object in Python?
    Answer: Iterable objects are the objects whose values or elements can be iterable using a loop i.e. for loop or while loop etc. Three types of iterable object in python are list, tuples and dictionaries etc.

26. What does function returns by default in Python?
    Answer: A function should always return a value. If we do not explicitly return a value or statement after the execution of a function then it returns a default value as None implicitly.

27. Write a Python function to find the maximum of three numbers.


28. Write a Python function to sum all the numbers in a list.
    Sample List : (8, 2, 3, 0, 7)
    Expected Output : 20

    (a non-negative integer). The function accepts the number as an argument.


32. Write a Python function to check whether a number falls within a given range.


33. Write a Python function that accepts a string and counts the number of upper and 
    lower case letters.

34. Write a Python function that takes a list and returns a new list with distinct 
    elements from the first list.

    Unique List : [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]


35. Write a Python function that takes a number as a parameter and checks whether 
    the number is prime or not.
    Note : A prime number (or a prime) is a natural number greater than 1 and that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.


36. Write a Python program to print the even numbers from a given list.
    
    Sample List : [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
    Expected Result : [2, 4, 6, 8]


37. Write a Python function to check whether a number is "Perfect" or not.

    According to Wikipedia : In number theory, a perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its proper positive divisors, that is, the sum of its positive divisors excluding the number itself (also known as its aliquot sum). Equivalently, a perfect number is a number that is half the sum of all of its positive divisors (including itself).
    Example : The first perfect number is 6, because 1, 2, and 3 are its proper positive divisors, and 1 + 2 + 3 = 6. Equivalently, the number 6 is equal to half the sum of all its positive divisors: ( 1 + 2 + 3 + 6 ) / 2 = 6. The next perfect number is 28 = 1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14. This is followed by the perfect numbers 496 and 8128.


38. Write a Python function that checks whether a passed string is a palindrome or not.
    Note: A palindrome is a word, phrase, or sequence that reads the same backward as forward, e.g., madam or nurses run.


39. Write a Python function that prints out the first n rows of Pascal's triangle.
    Note : Pascal's triangle is an arithmetic and geometric figure first imagined by Blaise Pascal.

    Sample Pascal's triangle :

    Pascal's triangle
    Each number is the two numbers above it added together


40. Write a Python function to check whether a string is a pangram or not.

    For example : "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"


41. Write a Python program that accepts a hyphen-separated sequence of words as input 
    and prints the words in a hyphen-separated sequence after sorting them alphabetically.
