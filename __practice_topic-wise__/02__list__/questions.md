301. Concatenate two lists index-wise

    Write a program to add two lists index-wise. Create a new list that contains the 0th index item from both the list, then the 1st index item, and so on till the last element. any leftover items will get added at the end of the new list.

302. Concatenate two lists in the following order

        list1 = ["Hello ", "take "]
        list2 = ["Dear", "Sir"]
        
        Expected output:
        ['Hello Dear', 'Hello Sir', 'take Dear', 'take Sir']

303.  Iterate both lists simultaneously
Given a two Python list. Write a program to iterate both lists simultaneously and display items from list1 in original order and items from list2 in reverse order.

Given

list1 = [10, 20, 30, 40]
list2 = [100, 200, 300, 400]
Expected output:

10 400
20 300
30 200
40 100



304. Remove empty strings from the list of strings
list1 = ["Mike", "", "Emma", "Kelly", "", "Brad"]
Expected output:

["Mike", "Emma", "Kelly", "Brad"]

305. Add new item to list after a specified item
Write a program to add item 7000 after 6000 in the following Python List

Given:

list1 = [10, 20, [300, 400, [5000, 6000], 500], 30, 40]
Expected output:

[10, 20, [300, 400, [5000, 6000, 7000], 500], 30, 40]


306. Extend nested list by adding the sublist
You have given a nested list. Write a program to extend it by adding the sublist ["h", "i", "j"] in such a way that it will look like the following list.

Given List:

list1 = ["a", "b", ["c", ["d", "e", ["f", "g"], "k"], "l"], "m", "n"]

# sub list to add
sub_list = ["h", "i", "j"]
Expected Output:

['a', 'b', ['c', ['d', 'e', ['f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j'], 'k'], 'l'], 'm', 'n']

307. Replace list’s item with new value if found
You have given a Python list. Write a program to find value 20 in the list, and if it is present, replace it with 200. Only update the first occurrence of an item.

Given:

list1 = [5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 50, 20]
Expected output:

[5, 10, 15, 200, 25, 50, 20]

308. Remove all occurrences of a specific item from a list.
Given a Python list, write a program to remove all occurrences of item 20.

Given:

list1 = [5, 20, 15, 20, 25, 50, 20]
Expected output:

[5, 15, 25, 50]

309. Remove empty Lists from List 

310. Given list values and keys list, convert these values to key value pairs in form of 
     list of dictionaries.

        Input : test_list = [“Gfg”, 3, “is”, 8], key_list = [“name”, “id”] 
        Output : [{‘name’: ‘Gfg’, ‘id’: 3}, {‘name’: ‘is’, ‘id’: 8}] 
        Explanation : Values mapped by custom key, “name” -> “Gfg”, “id” -> 3. 


        Input : test_list = [“Gfg”, 10], key_list = [“name”, “id”] 
        Output : [{‘name’: ‘Gfg’, ‘id’: 10}] 
        Explanation : Conversion of lists to list of records by keys mapping.

311. Convert List of Lists to Dictionary
    
     We are given list of lists we need to convert it to python . For example we are given a list of lists a = [[“a”, 1], [“b”, 2], [“c”, 3]] we need to convert the list in dictionary so that the output becomes {‘a’: 1, ‘b’: 2, ‘c’: 3}.

312. Uncommon elements in Lists of List
     
     The original list 1 : [[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]]
     The original list 2 : [[3, 4], [5, 7], [1, 2]]
     The uncommon of two lists is : [[5, 6], [5, 7]]

313. select Random value from list of lists

     Given a list of lists. The task is to extract a random element from it.

        Examples:

        Input : test_list = [[4, 5, 5], [2, 7, 4], [8, 6, 3]]
        Output : 7
        Explanation : Random number extracted from Matrix.
        
        Input : test_list = [[4, 5, 5], [2, 7, 4], [8, 6, 3]], r_no = 2
        Output : 6
        Explanation : Random number extracted from 2nd row from Matrix.

314. Reverse Row sort in Lists of List

     The original list is : [[4, 1, 6], [7, 8], [4, 10, 8]]
     The reverse sorted Matrix is : [[6, 4, 1], [8, 7], [10, 8, 4]]

315. Pair elements with Rear element in Matrix Row
     
     The original list is : [[4, 5, 6], [2, 4, 5], [6, 7, 5]]
     The list after pairing is : [[[4, 6], [5, 6]], [[2, 5], [4, 5]], [[6, 5], [7, 5]]]

316. Write a Python function to find the longest common sub-sequence in two lists.

317. Write a Python program to find the first non-repeated element in a list.

318. Write a Python function to sort a list of dictionaries based on values of a key.

319. Write a Python program to find all the pairs in a list whose sum is equal to a 
     given value.

320. Write a Python a function to implement a LRU cache.\

    From Wikipedia -
    Least recently used (LRU)
    Discards the least recently used items first. This algorithm requires keeping track of what was used when, which is expensive if one wants to make sure the algorithm always discards the least recently used item. General implementations of this technique require keeping "age bits" for cache-lines and track the "Least Recently Used" cache-line based on age-bits. In such an implementation, every time a cache-line is used, the age of all other cache-lines changes. LRU is actually a family of caching algorithms with members including 2Q by Theodore Johnson and Dennis Shasha, and LRU/K by Pat O'Neil, Betty O'Neil and Gerhard Weikum.

321. Write a Python function to reverse a list at a specific location.

322. Write a Python function find the length of the longest increasing sub-sequence in a list.

323. Write a Python function that finds all the permutations of the members of a list.

324. Write a Python function to find the kth smallest element in a list.

325. Write a Python function to find the kth largest element in a list.

326. Write a Python function to check if a list is a palindrome or not. Return true otherwise false.

327. Write a Python a function to find the union and intersection of two lists.

328. Write a Python function to remove duplicates from a list while preserving the order.

329. Write a Python a function to find the maximum sum sub-sequence in a list. Return the maximum value.
