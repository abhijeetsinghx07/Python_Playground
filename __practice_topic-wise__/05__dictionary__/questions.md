Exercise 1: Write a program to check whether a given key exists in a dictionary or not.
Hint
Given dict = {‘0’:1, ‘1’:2, ‘2’:3}
Input:
Enter value to check: 2

Expected output 
Result: True

Show Solution
Exercise 2: Write a program to iterate over dictionary items using for loop.
Hint
dict = {0:”Value 1″, 1:”Value 2″}

Expected output
Value of key 0 is Value 1
Value of key 1 is Value 2

Show Solution
Exercise 3: Write a program to print only keys of a dictionary.
Hint 
dict = {0:”Value 1″, 1:”Value 2″, 2:”Value 3″}

Expected output
Result: dict_keys([0, 1, 2])

Show Solution
Exercise 4: Write a program to print values of dictionary.
Hint 
dict = {0:”Value 1″, 1:”Value 2″, 2:”Value 3″}

Expected output
dict_values([‘Value 1’, ‘Value 2’, ‘Value 3’])

Show Solution
Exercise 5: Write a program in python to map 2 lists into a dictionary.
Hint 
Given keys = [1,2,3] values = [‘Value 1’, ‘Value 2’, ‘Value 3’]

Expected output
{1: ‘Value 1’, 2: ‘Value 2’, 3: ‘Value 3’}

Show Solution
Exercise 6: Python program to remove a set of keys.
Note: If we remove the key of the dictionary then the respective values of the dictionary should also be deleted. This means there are no values that exist without keys.

Hint 
Given:
{0:”Value 1″, 1:”Value 2″, 2:”Value 3″}
keys_to_remove = [0,1]

Expected output
Result : {2: ‘Value 3’}

Show Solution
Exercise 7: Python program to sort dictionary by values (Ascending/ Descending).
Hint 
Given
d = {‘key 1’: 2, ‘key 2’: 3, ‘key 3’: 4}

Expected output
Ascending: [(‘key 1’, 2), (‘key 2’, 3), (‘key 3’, 4)] Descending: [(‘key 3’, 4), (‘key 2’, 3), (‘key 1’, 2)]

Show Solution
Exercise 8: Write a program to concatenate two dictionaries to create one.
Hint 
Given
dict1 = {‘key 1’: 2, ‘key 2’: 3}
dict2 = {‘key 3’: 4, ‘key 4’: 5}

Expected output
{‘key 1’: 2, ‘key 2’: 3, ‘key 3’: 4, ‘key 4’: 5}

Show Solution
Exercise 9: Write a program to sum all the values of a dictionary.
Hint 
dict1 = {‘key 1’: 200, ‘key 2’: 300}

Expected output
Result: 500

Show Solution
Exercise 10: Write a program to get the maximum and minimum value of dictionary.
Hint 
dict1 = {‘key 1’: 200, ‘key 2’: 300}

Expected output
Max: 300
Min: 200

Show Solution
Exercise 11: Write a program to check if a dictionary is empty or not.
Hint 
Given dict1 = {}

Expected output
Is dictionary empty ? : True

Show Solution
Exercise 12: Write a program in Python to choose a random item from a list.
Hint 
dict1 = {‘key 1’: 22, ‘key 2’: 301}
# we are checking for 22 value

Expected output
Value exists in dictionary

Show Solution
Exercise 13: Write a program to sort dictionary values in python.
Hint 
dict1 = {
‘key 1’: ‘Apple’, ‘key 2′:’Mango’,
‘key 3′:’Papaya’
}

Expected output
key 1: Apple
key 2: Mango
key 3: Papaya

Show Solution
Exercise 14: Write a program to check whether a key exists in the dictionary or not.
Hint 
dict1 = {‘key 1’: 22, ‘key 2’: 301}

Expected output
Key exists in dictionary

Show Solution
Exercise 15: Write a program in python to map keys to dictionary.
Hint 
key = [‘Fruit’, ‘Vegetable’] value = [‘Mango’,’Tomato’]

Expected output
{‘Fruit’: ‘Mango’, ‘Vegetable’: ‘Tomato’}

Show Solution
Exercise 16: Write a program in Python to remove repetitive items from a list.
Hint 
Given num = [2,3,4,5,2,6,3,2]

Expected output
Result: [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
