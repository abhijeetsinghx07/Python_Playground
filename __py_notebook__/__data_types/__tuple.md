# Tuple

- A **tuple** is an **immutable** sequence data type in Python. Like lists, tuples are used to store multiple items in a single variable, but unlike lists, **tuples cannot be modified (i.e., they are immutable)** after their creation. They are typically used to group related data.
- A **tuple** is a built-in data type in Python that represents an **ordered, immutable collection of items**. Tuples are similar to lists, but unlike lists, their elements **cannot be changed** (immutable).
- **Default value**: ()
- It is highly recommend for Data Security need. Because it is immutable.

### **Characteristics of Tuples**:

- **Immutable**: Once created, elements in a tuple cannot be changed, added, or removed.
- **Ordered**: Tuples maintain the order of elements.
- **Heterogeneous**: Tuples can contain elements of different data types (e.g., strings, integers, lists, etc.).
- **Indexing**: Elements of a tuple can be accessed via indexing.
- **Duplicates Allowed**: Tuples can contain duplicate elements.

### **Key Features of Tuples**

1. **Ordered**:
    - Tuples maintain the order of items, and they can be accessed via an **index**.
    - Example:
        
        ```python
        my_tuple = (10, 20, 30)
        print(my_tuple[1])  # Output: 20
        
        ```
        
2. **Immutable**:
    - Once created, tuples cannot be changed. You cannot add, remove, or modify elements.
    - Example:
        
        ```python
        my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)
        # my_tuple[1] = 5  # TypeError: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment
        
        ```
        
3. **Heterogeneous**:
    - A single tuple can contain items of different data types.
    - Example:
        
        ```python
        mixed_tuple = (1, "hello", 3.14, True)
        print(mixed_tuple)  # Output: (1, 'hello', 3.14, True)
        
        ```
        
4. **Allow Duplicates**:
    - Tuples can have duplicate elements.
    - Example:
        
        ```python
        my_tuple = (1, 1, 2, 3)
        print(my_tuple)  # Output: (1, 1, 2, 3)
        
        ```
        
5. **Lightweight and Faster**:
    - Tuples are faster and consume less memory compared to lists because they are immutable.

### **How to Create a Tuple**

1. **Using Parentheses `()`**:
    
    ```python
    my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)
    
    ```
    
2. **Without Parentheses (Tuple Packing)**:
    - You can create a tuple without parentheses (though parentheses improve readability).
    
    ```python
    my_tuple = 1, 2, 3
    print(my_tuple)  # Output: (1, 2, 3)
    
    ```
    
3. **Empty Tuple**:
    
    ```python
    empty_tuple = ()
    
    ```
    
4. **Single-Element Tuple**:
    - To create a single-element tuple, add a **comma** after the element.
    
    ```python
    single_tuple = (5,)  # Without the comma, it's just an integer
    print(type(single_tuple))  # Output: <class 'tuple'>
    
    ```
    
5. **Using `tuple()` Constructor**:
    
    ```python
    my_tuple = tuple([1, 2, 3])  # Convert a list into a tuple
    print(my_tuple)  # Output: (1, 2, 3)
    
    ```
    
6. **Nested Tuple**:
    - Tuples can contain other tuples as elements.
    
    ```python
    nested_tuple = (1, (2, 3), (4, (5, 6)))
    
    ```

### **Tuple Indexing and Slicing**

1. **Accessing Elements by Index**:
    - Use indexing to access individual elements (index starts at `0`).
    
    ```python
    my_tuple = (10, 20, 30, 40)
    print(my_tuple[1])  # Output: 20
    print(my_tuple[-1])  # Output: 40
    
    ```
    
2. **Slicing**:
    - Extract a portion of a tuple using slicing (`start:end:step`).
    
    ```python
    my_tuple = (10, 20, 30, 40, 50)
    print(my_tuple[1:4])  # Output: (20, 30, 40)
    print(my_tuple[::-1])  # Output: (50, 40, 30, 20, 10)
    
    ```

### **Tuple Methods**

Since tuples are immutable, they have **fewer methods** compared to lists. Here are the available tuple methods:

---

### **1. `count()`**

- Returns the **number of times** a value appears in the tuple.

```python
my_tuple = (1, 2, 3, 2, 2)
print(my_tuple.count(2))  # Output: 3

```

---

### **2. `index()`**

- Returns the **index** of the first occurrence of a specified value.

```python
my_tuple = (10, 20, 30, 20)
print(my_tuple.index(20))  # Output: 1

```

---

### **Operations with Tuples**

### **1. Concatenation**

- Combine two tuples using the `+` operator.

```python
tuple1 = (1, 2)
tuple2 = (3, 4)
result = tuple1 + tuple2
print(result)  # Output: (1, 2, 3, 4)

```

---

### **2. Repetition**

- Repeat a tuple multiple times using the `` operator.

```python
my_tuple = (1, 2)
print(my_tuple * 3)  # Output: (1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2)

```

---

### **3. Membership Test**

- Check if an element exists in a tuple using the `in` keyword.

```python
my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)
print(2 in my_tuple)  # Output: True

```

---

### **4. Iteration**

- Use a `for` loop to iterate over a tuple.

```python
my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)
for item in my_tuple:
    print(item)

```

---

### **Tuple Unpacking**

You can unpack a tuple into separate variables.

```python
my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)
a, b, c = my_tuple
print(a, b, c)  # Output: 1 2 3

```

For variable-length unpacking:

```python
my_tuple = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
a, *b, c = my_tuple
print(a, b, c)  # Output: 1 [2, 3, 4] 5

```

---

### **Interesting Notes about Tuples**

1. **Tuples Can Contain Mutable Objects**:
    - While tuples themselves are immutable, they can contain mutable objects like lists.
    
    ```python
    my_tuple = (1, [2, 3])
    my_tuple[1].append(4)  # Modifies the list inside the tuple
    print(my_tuple)  # Output: (1, [2, 3, 4])
    
    ```
    
2. **Tuples Are Faster Than Lists**:
    - Since tuples are immutable, they are optimized for performance and use less memory compared to lists.
3. **Tuples Can Be Used as Keys in Dictionaries**:
    - Tuples are hashable, so they can be used as dictionary keys (unlike lists).
    
    ```python
    my_dict = {(1, 2): "value"}
    print(my_dict[(1, 2)])  # Output: value
    
    ```
    
4. **Tuples Are Used for Fixed Data**:
    - Tuples are ideal for data that should not change, like geographical coordinates, RGB color codes, or database records.

### **Comparison of Lists and Tuples**

| **Feature** | **List** | **Tuple** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Mutability** | Mutable (can change) | Immutable (cannot change) |
| **Syntax** | Square brackets `[ ]` | Parentheses `( )` |
| **Performance** | Slower than tuples | Faster than lists |
| **Methods** | More methods (like `append()`) | Fewer methods (`count()`, `index()`) |
| **Hashable** | Not hashable | Hashable (if elements are immutable) |
| **Use Case** | Dynamic data | Fixed/constant data |

---

### **When to Use Tuples**

1. **Data That Should Not Change**:
    - Tuples are ideal for storing constants or fixed data.
    - Example:
        
        ```python
        coordinates = (40.7128, -74.0060)  # Latitude and longitude of New York City
        
        ```
        
2. **Dictionary Keys**:
    - Use tuples when you need to create composite keys for dictionaries.
3. **Improved Performance**:
    - Use tuples when working with large datasets that donâ€™t need to change, as they are faster and memory-efficient.

### **Summary**

| **Feature** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Definition** | Immutable, ordered collection of items. |
| **Key Features** | Ordered, immutable, heterogeneous, duplicates allowed. |
| **Creation** | Using `()`, tuple packing, or `tuple()` constructor. |
| **Access** | Via indexing or slicing. |
| **Methods** | `count()`, `index()`. |
| **Interesting Properties** | Tuples are faster, hashable, and memory-efficient. |

### **When to Use Tuples vs Lists**

- **Use tuples** when you need a collection of items that should not change after creation (immutability). They are great for fixed data, such as coordinates, days of the week, and so on.
- **Use lists** when you need a mutable collection of items, allowing changes, additions, or removals.

---

### **Example Use Case: Returning Multiple Values from a Function**

Tuples are commonly used to return multiple values from a function. Since tuples are immutable, they prevent accidental modification of the returned values.

### Example:

```python
def get_person_info():
    name = "Alice"
    age = 30
    city = "New York"
    return name, age, city  # Returns a tuple

# Unpacking the tuple into variables
person_name, person_age, person_city = get_person_info()
print(person_name)  # Output: Alice
print(person_age)   # Output: 30
print(person_city)  # Output: New York

```
### **Tuple Methods and Functions**

| **`sum()`** | Returns the sum of all elements in the tuple |  |
| **`sorted()`** | Returns a sorted list from the elements of the tuple |  |
