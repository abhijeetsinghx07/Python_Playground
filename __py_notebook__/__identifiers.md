## What is Identifiers ?

- **Identifiers** are used to name a variable, a function, a class, a structure, a union.
- In other words, an identifier is created to give a unique name to an entity.
- It can consist of alphabets, digits, and underscores, and can be written in uppercase or lowercase.

> **Rules for Python identifiers:**
> 
- A Identifiers name must start with a letter or the underscore character.
- A Identifiers name cannot start with a number.
- We can’t use special symbols in a identifier name.
- A Identifiers name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
- Identifiers names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)
- We can’t use python keywords as a identifier

### Variable v/s Identifier

| **Variables** | **Identifier** |
| --- | --- |
| Variables are used to store data. | Identifier is used to name a variable, a function, a class, a structure, a union. |
| Variables are declared using an identifier. | Identifiers are used to declare variables, functions, classes, etc. |
| Variables have a datatype. The data type of a variable denotes the kind of data that can be stored in it. | Identifiers do not have a data type. |
| Variables have a value. The value of a variable can be modified during the execution of the program. | Identifiers do not hold a value. |
| Variables do not have naming conventions. They can be named anything. | Identifiers must follow a naming convention. Identifiers must be meaningful and descriptive. |
| All the variables names are identifiers. | All identifiers are not variables. |
| Variable is created to assign a unique name to a specific memory location. | Identifiers are created assign a name to an entity. |
